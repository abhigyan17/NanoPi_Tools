# NanoPi R2S Tools, SDKs & Images Backup Repository

Welcome to the **NanoPi R2S Tools, SDKs & Images Backup** repository.  
This repo is a **ready-to-use archive of verified, fully working operating system images, software development kits (SDKs), tools, and source code** for the **NanoPi R2S** single-board computer.

Rather than being a step-by-step installation guide, this is a **preservation and convenience resource**.  
You are free to use, modify, or adapt anything here for your own projects.

This repository and its resources are part of the broader NanoPi ecosystem, which includes popular models such as the NanoPi R2S, NanoPi R4S, NanoPi R6S, NanoPi Neo, NanoPi R5S, NanoPi Neo4, NanoPi R5C, NanoPi Neo3, NanoPi M4, and NanoPi Neo2. Enthusiasts working with accessories like the 4x SATA HAT for NanoPi M4 or using platforms such as the Allwinner H3 Quad-Core Cortex-A7 will find these tools invaluable. While NanoPi brings powerful hardware options, the blending of Arduino Nano Pi projects offers even more flexibility for embedded applications. This repository also supports firmware solutions including FriendlyWrt and OpenWrt, renowned for their capabilities in IPv6 networking, router customization, and print server setups. Users working with OpenWrt can leverage it across diverse hardware, including x86 architectures, and enjoy features such as WiFi 6 support. Common configuration scenarios such as accessing web interfaces via URLs like http://192.168.0.1 or http://192.168.1.1 on TP-Link or Linksys routers, or managing accounts at cloudtrax.com, are part of the networking environments this repository aims to complement. For those interested in exploring the OpenWrt Table of Hardware or integrating LEDE router projects, this collection offers foundational tools and images to facilitate those endeavors. Whether working with OpenWrt Linux distributions or custom OpenWrt router firmware, this archive stands as a comprehensive reference for the NanoPi and open-source networking communities.
